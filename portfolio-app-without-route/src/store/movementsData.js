Lindsay Anderson, its undisputed founder and spokesman, later admitted, "Free Cinema, whether as a specific historical movement, or as a genre, or as an inspiration, has been defined, written about or attacked in terms so various that it isn't surprising there is now a great deal of confusion as to what exactly the term implies."An explanation is therefore needed.

They were the first generation of filmmakers who hadn’t come through the system or via theatre, novels or television; instead they had learned film as film. Raised on watching movies on TV from an early age, they had learned their craft at film school — Coppola at UCLA, Lucas and Milius at USC, Scorsese at NYU and De Palma at Columbia, whereas Spielberg created his own movie curriculum by making films from 11 — and as such were both technically proficient — listen out for the dense use of sound in the films of Coppola and Lucas — and steeped in film lore.

They also swapped profit participation points in their movies meaning they would receive a percentage of the gross. Lucas and Spielberg and Milius swapped points for Star Wars, and Close Encounters Of The Third Kind — a fair trade.

    content:`As the name suggests, German expressionist filmmakers used visual distortion and hyper-expressive performance to show inner turmoils, fears and desires of that era. German Expressionism reflects the inner conflicts of its 1920s German audience by giving their woes an inescapably external presence. By rejecting cinematic realism, expressionist films showcase dramatic, revolutionary interpretations of the human condition.

    How German Expressionism began

    n 1916, the German government decided to ban all foreign films. With a sudden demand for more domestic titles, there was an understandably dramatic increase in the number of films produced in Germany each year. However, German audiences had become less preferential towards romance and action flicks since the beginning of WWI, and themes of violence, cruelty and betrayal become more relevant topics for discussion. This unfortunate set of circumstances, along with the constant fear of hyperinflation, provided a platform for daring, innovative filmmakers such as Fritz Lang (Metropolis) and F.W. Murnau (Nosferatu) to make German Expressionism one of the most important and influential movements in cinematic history.

"I am profoundly fascinated by cruelty, fear, horror and death. My films show my preoccupation with violence, the pathology of violence." - Fritz Lang

Unlike most other cinematic movements, Expressionism doesn't solely belong to filmmaking, and existed prior to the invention of cinema. Fortunately, this helps us understand Expressionist principles and how they were utilized by filmmakers. Consider Edvard Munch's The Scream, arguably the most famous Expressionist painting of all time; you can clearly see how the concept allows moods to be expressed by creative distortion. It shows an impression of a scene, as opposed to its physical reality. On film, this ideology can apply to every aspect of the creative process, from dream-like set designs to melodramatic on-screen performances. For this reason, German Expressionist cinema also has close-knit ties to architectural design. Films such as The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and Metropolis are often studied as perfect examples of how set design can be used to create a world that is aesthetically controlled by the film's emotional instructions.

German Expressionist film Portrays a Subjective, Emotional World

The movement radically challenged conventional filmmaking at the time, and has provided food for thought for the industry ever since. Today, the enduring influence of German Expressionism can be seen throughout the medium, with critically acclaimed directors such as Ridley Scott and Tim Burton consistently taking influence from Expressionist work. On a broader scale, German Expressionism's enduring impact within the horror genre cannot be overstated, helping to shape the genre's frameworks upon which the entire genre still relies on.

    content:`The French Impressionist filmmakers took their name from their painterly compatriots and applied it to a 1920s boom in silent film that jolted cinema in thrilling new directions. The devastation of World War I parlayed into films that delved into the darker corners of the human psyche and had a good rummage about while they were there. New techniques in non-linear editing, point-of-view storytelling and camera work abounded. Abel Gance’s Napoleon introduced the widescreen camera and even stuck a camera operator on rollerskates to get a shot, while Marcel L'Herbier experimented with stark new lighting styles. Directors like Gance, Germaine Dulac and Jean Epstein found valuable support from Pathé Fréres and Leon Gaumont, France’s main production houses, in a reaction to the stifling influx of American films.
    \n\n
    As film writer David Parkinson points out in 100 Ideas That Changed Film, the group’s figurehead, Louis Delluc, was instrumental in the still-new art form being embraced as something apart, artistically and geographically. “French cinema must be cinema,” he stressed. “French cinema must be French.” And being French, it wasn’t afraid to get a little sexy if the circumstances demanded. Germaine Dulac’s The Seashell And The Clergyman, an early step towards surrealism, gets into the head of a lascivious priest gingering after a general’s wife in a way usually frowned on in religious circles. There’s much leering, a fractured psyche depicted by unnerving editing, strange awake-scapes and a seashell you definitely wouldn’t put anywhere near your ear. Like much of the movement’s output, it’s bonkers and brilliant, with a capacity to surprise that’s barely faded.`,

    content:`Even if you’ve never seen a 1920s Russian film (what have you been doing with your life?), you’ll still have noticed one of the most recognisable editing techniques in film history: the montage. It all kicked off when Russian director-cum-theorist Lev Kuleshov realised that an actor’s expression wasn’t enough to convey a specific idea, therefore juxtaposed images must. Cue the so-called ‘Kuleshov Effect’. The director intercut shots of faces with related images to generate an emotional response in his spectators.

    It was a new style of editing that spurned capitalism by going against the smooth, romantic editing prolific at the time and generally stirred up the creative juices of directors everywhere. Sergei Eisenstein’s work (Battleship Potemkin, most famously) was inspired by Kuleshov and refused to spoonfeed audiences, cutting between random imagery to make viewers decipher an idea or feeling. This jarring style was also used as a medium through which to ‘educate’ the working classes. As such his films rarely focused on one protagonist alone. The hero here was ‘the people’ and many of the film’s leading characters weren’t given names in an aim to unify the main players.

    This technique changed the way film integrated time and space and evolved into the ‘montage’ we know today and that is seen so much throughout cinema history. Citizen Kane, Rocky, Scarface and Commando all use montages, if in a slightly less intensive form than its Russian creators intended.`

    content:`A movement born both of mood and resources, Neorealism emerged at a time when the former was one of disillusionment and the lack of the latter necessitated new levels of guile from its key players. Italy’s main film studio, Cinecittà, had been bombed by the Allies – presumably after watching a few of Mussolini’s fascist rom-coms – so directors like Roberto Rossellini and Vittorio De Sica took to the streets, using available lighting, non-professional actors and minimal equipment to capture stories of humble people scratching out a living in straits so dire you could put a headband on them and call them ‘Knopfler’.

    Spearheaded by Luchino Visconti’s Ossessione, a James M. Cain crime thriller clad in the garb of a gutsy character drama, the movement continued to bloom long after Benito Mussolini and his fascist goons were gone and their censorship lifted. “Cinema is the most powerful weapon,” the fascists’ head of propaganda had asserted, but the Neorealists, some affluent (Visconti) and some born in poverty (De Sica), reforged it into a tool for social change by depicting the privations of Italian (and in Germany, Year Zero, German) society. Their struggling, blue-collar heroes and heroines weren’t played by glamorous movie stars but Bicycle Thieves’ Lamberto Maggiorani, a steelworker, and first-timer Antonio Arcidiacono in La Terra Trema. Writers like Cesare Zavattini and Umberto Barbaro penned scripts with heartache as a leitmotif.

    Gradually the movement drifted apart as its key players embraced fantasy (De Sica’s Miracle In Milan) and big historical canvasses (Visconti’s Senso), and a new voice, Federico Fellini, emerged to mix comedy, escapism and drama into an intoxicating new cocktail with White Sheik and I Vitelloni. In a few short years though, it left enduring classics that appear on any top ten you care to mention.`

    content:`Taking its name from the Nouvelle Vague, the Japanese New Wave (Nūberu bāgu) originated during a period of drastic societal change in Japan following the end of WWII. With an emphasis on taboo subjects and experimental storytelling, Japanese New Wave cinema explored themes of violence, radicalised youth culture and the country’s apparent delinquency epidemic. As well as bringing vice to the forefront of Japanese cinema, the new wave challenged well-established filmmaking constructs with innovative editing, composition and narrative techniques. But considering the radical, unconventional nature of the Japanese New Wave, it has a surprisingly corporate origin.

    In 1955, popular Japanese studios systematically created this ultra-modern movement in order to regain the public’s interest in new releases. However, don’t let this dishearten you, as the Japanese New Wave gave filmmakers a rare opportunity to bring genuinely innovative ideas to mainstream cinema. The Japanese New Wave consistently pushed the boundaries of what could be shown in theatres, often discussing the carnality of mankind with stories of corruption, lewd realities and unadulterated societal truths.

Perhaps inevitably, the young filmmakers tasked with crafting the Japanese New Wave would become dissatisfied with their roles within large studios, allowing the movement to progress with independent productions and the ATG (Arts Theatre Guild). It’s this shift that arguably prevented the movement from becoming purely exploitative of taboo subjects, allowing Japanese New Wave cinema to be remembered for its analytical, philosophical approach towards Japan's societal issues.

“Why make a movie about something one understands completely? I make movies about things I do not understand, but wish to.” - Seijun Suzuki

Throughout the 1960s, new wave directors such as Seijun Suzuki, Hiroshi Teshigahara and Nagisa Oshima would continue to experiment with innovative editing, composition and narrative techniques, leading them to become world-renowned directors that still boast international cult followings.

This cruel Britannia, bomb-damaged and drained, was the heartland of a new wave that took Free Cinema’s baton and ran with it… well, strode to the nearest pub with it, moodily puffing on a fag.

At the vanguard were Lindsay Anderson, Karel Reisz and Tony Richardson, three stalwarts of Free Cinema, spearheading a style of filmmaking that was light on frills (don’t come here for nouvelle vague frippery or jump cuts) but heavy on dramatic fireworks. It was a time when men were men, and usually pretty grumpy with it. They were surly rebels like Arthur Seaton (Saturday Night And Sunday Morning, pictured above), Jimmy Porter (Look Back In Anger), Colin Smith (The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner), gifted outsiders like Frank Machin (This Sporting Life) and dreamers, of whom Billy Fisher (Billy Liar), was the dreamiest – Yorkshire’s answer to Walter Mitty. In a short burst, this unofficial movement delivered a fistful of great dramas. A large proportion are well-established Brit classics; others, like The L-Shaped Room (1963), are well worth searching out.`

    content:`The French New Wave is perhaps the greatest advocation for the important of film criticism, giving the film industry a fine example of how critical analysis directly leads to the progression of the industry as a whole; after all, the entire movement was founded by critics.

    In 1948, Alexandre Astruc published The Birth of New Avante-Garde: The Camera-Stylo, a manifesto outlining the power of cinema as an artistic tool. He argued that cinema could rival the creative possibilities of literature and traditional artwork, and therefore showed disdain towards the relatively new medium’s commercialisation. These values were passionately shared by the critics of Cahiers du cinema; Francois Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard, Jacques Rivette, Claude Chabrol and Éric Rohmer. Collectively, the group continued to explore Astruc’s principles and develop their own vision, which would become known as auteur theory (La politique des auteurs).

Auteur theory puts an emphasis on the creative direction of a creator, mirroring the way we traditionally value the vision of a singular poet or painter; the director is an artist, and as the film’s ‘author’, their unique vision is key to the film’s artistic value.

"The film of tomorrow appears to me as even more personal than an individual and autobiographical novel, like a confession, or a diary." – Francois Truffaut

Due to this principle, directors such as Jean Renoir, Orson Welles and Alfred Hitchcock were seen as hugely important examples of why auteurship is artistically superior to commercial adaptations and other titles that simply pander to box office expectations. However, the Cahiers writers went one step further than to simply praise established auteurs. Instead, they set out to utilise auteur theory with films of their own.

In 1959, Francois Truffaut released The 400 Blows, and Jean-Luc Godard’s Breathless would follow less than a year later. Both titles received unexpected international success and were praised for their innovate filmmaking techniques. Among others, these titles gave the French New Wave a worldwide appeal, allowing the movement to thrive throughout the ‘60s. Since then, new wave cinema has been a constant inspiration to young filmmakers worldwide.

    content:`Prior to the New Wave, Hong Kong’s film industry was already world-renowned for kung-fu action flicks. In fact, it’s important to note that Hong Kong had such a thriving filmmaking culture that it was the only industry thought to be able to contest against Hollywood at the time. It was still uncommon for Chinese households to have a TV set in the 1970s, and the comparatively liberal culture of Hong Kong allowed the industry to produce films that were less censored that those created on Mainland China. However, there was still a sense among young filmmakers that the industry had become formulaic. This led the likes of Tsui Hark, Ann Hui, and Patrick Tam to challenge the industry’s norms, kick-starting the Hong Kong New Wave in 1979.

    How the Hong Kong New Wave began

    Many directors of the Hong Kong New Wave studied overseas, and were therefore bringing some westernised approaches to cinema to the East. In fact, the new wave bridges East and West in a way that could perhaps only have happened in Hong Kong, given the Island's complicated political history as a British colonial city for 157 years. This unique and now-iconic blend of eastern and western principles towards filmmaking makes the Hong Kong New Wave instantly recognisable.

Although Hong Kong's new wave is less aesthetically defined than other movements, the term is used to express a broader influence outside of mainstream Chinese filmmaking. In this way, the movement was used to define those who weren’t following the status quo, and instead wanted to develop the industry with radical editing techniques, synchronous sound and hot-footed production crews that would shoot on-location, with or without a permit.

Despite these progressive techniques, many new wave films stay within traditional genres because films in Hong Kong were financed entirely by pre-sales. This explains why so many titles, such as Wong Kar-wai's Chungking Express and Fallen Angels, focus on cops, gangsters and delinquents, despite ultimately exploring their emotional journeys as opposed to action-based storytelling.

The Second Wave: An International Influence

"This is what the difference is between Hong Kong and Chinese cinema - Chinese cinema was made for their own communities. It was for propaganda. But Hong Kong made films to entertain, and they know how to communicate with international audiences." - Wong Kar-wai

In 1984, the movement embraced a ‘second wave’, where directors such as Stanley Kwan, Mabel Cheung, Peter Chan, Fruit Chan, Tammy Cheung, Alex Law and Wong Kar-wai garnered international attention for continuing to challenge the frameworks of Hong Kong cinema. Among these, director Wong Kar-wai has emerged to become the most acclaimed, winning the Palme D’or at Cannes Film Festival in 2001 for In the Mood for Love and boasting an incredibly devoted worldwide following.

    filmmakers:["Lars von Trier", "Thomas Vinterberg", "Kristian Levring", "Søren Kragh-Jacobsen", "Lone Scherfig"],
    content:`On March 13, 1995, a Parisian conference was held to celebrate 100 years of film. Appropriately named Le cinéma vers son deuxième siècle, the event was specifically focused on cinema’s second century and had invited Danish director Lars von Trier to speak. Prior to his speech, audience members (which included many of the film industry’s most respected names) were handed red pamphlets that would formally announce Dogme 95.

    How Dogme 95 began: Vow of Chastity:

    Together with Thomas Vinterberg, Trier had created a manifesto that deliberately mimicked Truffaut’s Une certaine tendance du cinema, the Cahiers du cinéma article that kickstarted the French New Wave in 1954. Within their manifesto, Trier and Vinterberg compiled a “Vow of Chastity”, in which they laid out the strict terms that would determine whether or not a film could be considered part of the Dogme 95 movement.

    1. Shooting must be performed on location, without providing props or sets that don't logically exist within that setting

    2. Diegetic sound only. Sounds must never be produced, such as music that does not exist within the scene

    3. All shots must be handheld. Movement, immobility and stability must be attained by hand

    4. The film must be in colour, with no special lighting. If there's not enough exposure, a single lamp may be attached to the camera

    5. There can be no optical work or lens filters

    6. No 'superficial' action (such as staged murders, elaborate stunts etc.)

    7. Geographical alienation is strictly forbidden, meaning the film must take place here and now

    8. No genre movies

    9. Academy 35mm is the only accepted film format

    10. Directors must not be credited

Compared to any other movement in film history, Dogme 95 is perhaps the easiest to define thanks to the hard lines drawn by this manifesto. Although these restrictions would certainly alienate many filmmakers from participating in the movement, the specificity of Vinterberg and Trier’s Vows of Chastity clearly outlines how the Dogme 95 manifesto planned to change cinema’s future.

"If one devalues rationality, the world tends to fall apart." - Lars von Trier

First and foremost, Dogme 95 intended to generate a greater focus on the values of traditional storytelling, performance and specific themes. With an emphasis on these core aspects of filmic storytelling, Dogme 95 was a backlash against the over-reliance on technology such as special effects and groundbreaking digital tools. In this way, the movement was in direct opposition to commercial studio filmmaking at the time, and was a clear attempt to give greater power to independent creative team.

The movement would consequently form a Dogme 95 collective that included filmmakers from around the world. Also known as the ‘Dogme 95 Brethren,’ this saw Kristian Levring and Søren Kragh-Jacobsen join Vinterberg and Lars von Trier, all of whom created titles that obeyed the Vows of Chastity. However, not all films would strictly abide by every rule. When submitting a film for consideration, the director was required to ‘confess’ the ways in which they have failed to comply with their vows. For example, when submitting Julien Donkey-Boy, Harmony Korine noted a series of rule-bending during the film’s production. This ranged from faking Chloë Sevigny’s pregnant belly to buying a batch of raw cranberries.

“In joining the Dogme Brotherhood … I proudly abandon-ed those cinema tactics that I have been brought up in. And in doing this, I succumbed to a religious-like semi-calvinist fervour. But, as when I was a child, the temptation to sin was always a romantic option.” - Harmony Korine

Three years after the manifesto’s announcement, the first official Dogme 95 film was released by Vinterberg. Titled The Celebration (Festen), the film was an instant critical success, winning the Jury Prize at the 1998 Cannes Film Festival.

"I think Dogme was inspiring for quite a few peoples and sort of started a digital movement. Personally, I found it extremely uplifting and fantastic making Dogme movies, but I felt I completed it with 'The Celebration.' I think that was the end of the road on Dogme for me. It was as far as I could go." - Thomas Vinterberg

There are 35 Dogme films in total, with Lars von Trier remaining the most internationally recognised figure from the movement. Just like Vinterberg, he would eventually deviate from the Vows of Chastity’s constraints, in search of new challenges as cinema entered the 21st Century.

It was a time when upper lips were stiff and pride in imperial commerce was everywhere, but while these were often fairly uncritical looks at Britain’s ‘commonwealth of nations’, Grierson and his acolytes, men like Harry Watt, Basil Wright and Humphrey Jennings, pushed filmmaking in all sorts of interesting new directions.

    When the EMB ditched the Don of the documentary and his team from its balance sheet in 1933, the Post Office’s GPO Film Unit stepped in. This posse of mostly middle-class men (Grierson was a philosophy grad) went on to turn in new types of narrative films, like the Night Mail, a kind of Brylcreemed Unstoppable, that combined Benjamin Britten’s music, W. H. Auden’s lyricism and future Ealing director Alberto Cavalcanti’s sound into a dreamlike marvel of steam and stoicism on the railways. The latter was tested by the war, when the GPO Film Unit, with Grierson, Watt and surrealist painter Humphrey Jennings, brought their skills to bear as propagandists.`,

If the answer to any of these is ‘yes’, welcome to poetic realism! This was a glorious era in French cinema that emerged from a particularly inglorious phase of French history.

    Imbued with the prevailing gloom of the time, the films of “le réalisme poétique” are populated with fatalistic figures often played by Jean Gabin, Arletty or Jean Dasté, and plucked from the pages of great writers like Émile Zola and Leo Tolstoy or penned by writers like Jacques Prévert and Charles Spaak. Characters like Gabin’s jewel thief Pépé Le Moko, trapped like a rat in an Algiers casbah, and Pierre Fresnay’s self-sacrificing aristocrat in Grand Illusion were emblematic of a country at odds with itself and swirling slowly towards the plughole of another ruinous war.

    The movement’s directors were a motley array, with little to thread them together beyond their artistry. Carné was the son of a cabinet maker; Duvivier, a gifted actor himself; Jean Grémillon, a Norman with aspirations to compose classical music; while Jean Renoir, of course, was scion of a certain Claude Renoir who was known to paint a bit. This flowering of French cinema was abetted by a deeply talented pool of writers, set designers, composers and movie stars, of whom the saltily sexy Gabin, a Bogart for the boulevardiers, remains a chiselled figurehead.`

      ${freeCin2nd}
 Free Cinema was created primarily for pragmatic reasons. In early 1956, as Anderson and his friends Karel Reisz, Tony Richardson and Lorenza Mazzetti were struggling to get their films shown, they decided to join forces and screen them together in a single programme at the National Film Theatre, which Reisz had conveniently been programming for three years. They soon realised that although the films had been made independently, they had a definite 'attitude in common'. Anderson coined the term 'Free Cinema' (a reference to the films having been made free from the pressures of the box-office or the demands of propaganda), and together produced a 'manifesto' in which they stated the ideas behind the presentation of the programme. Although the name was intended only for that one-off event, the 'publicity stunt' proved so effective - with the event attracting wide press attention and all screenings sold out - that five more programmes were shown under the same banner in the next three years, each accompanied by a programme note in the form of a manifesto.

  But Free Cinema was much more than just a clever piece of cultural packaging. It represented a new attitude to filmmaking, rejecting the orthodoxy and conservatism of both the mainstream British cinema and the dominant documentary tradition initiated by John Grierson in the 1930s. The Free Cinema group dismissed mainstream 1950s British films as completely detached from the reality of everyday contemporary life in Britain, and condemned their stereotypical and patronising representation of the working class. As the programme note for the third Free Cinema programme stated:"British cinema [is] still obstinately class-bound; still rejecting the stimulus of contemporary life, as well as the responsibility to criticise; still reflecting a metropolitan, Southern English culture which excludes the rich diversity of tradition and personality which is the whole of Britain." In contrast, the Free Cinema filmmakers affirmed their "belief in freedom, the importance of people and in the significance of the everyday" (Free Cinema manifesto). Their films attempted to rehabilitate an objective, critical, yet respectful and often affectionate portrayal of ordinary people at work or at play.

   At the same time, they were strong advocates of the filmmaker's freedom to express his/her personal views through film - "no film can be too personal", insisted the first manifesto - of the commitment of the filmmaker as an artist, and of his/her role as a vocal social commentator. The one British documentarist the Free Cinema members admired was Humphrey Jennings, whose style, in such films as London Can Take It! (1940) and Fires Were Started (1943), was distinguished by a quest for authenticity and poetic form. Free Cinema's critical and theoretical background was set out in the journal Sequence (until 1952) and then in Sight and Sound, for which Anderson, Reisz and their colleagues wrote.

  One obvious common denominator of the Free Cinema films (and a prerequisite to their makers' creative freedom) was the fact that they were all made outside the framework of the film industry. They were produced in semi-amateur conditions (all but three on 16mm film), and used the same enthusiastic and skilful (but mainly unpaid) technicians, particularly cameraman Walter Lassally and sound-recordist/editor John Fletcher. The active and generous contribution of these two pioneering technicians was a direct link between most of the Free Cinema films; this alone made Free Cinema much more than a label of convenience. The films were funded either by their makers or by small grants from two main sponsors, who gave them almost complete creative freedom. The BFI Experimental Film Fund, a tiny fund for innovative films set up and administrated by the British Film Institute since 1952, provided financial assistance for six of the films. The Ford Motor Company sponsored the two most ambitious productions, Anderson's Every Day Except Christmas and Reisz's We Are the Lambeth Boys.

   The films also shared a number of formal and stylistic features. Typically, they were short (the longest was We Are the Lambeth Boys, at 50 minutes), used black and white film and hand-held, portable cameras, avoided or limited the use of didactic voice-over commentary, shunned narrative continuity and used sound and editing impressionistically. Their distinctive aesthetic was a consequence of three main factors: a conscious decision to take their cameras out of the studios and into the streets in order to engage with the reality of contemporary Britain; the extremely limited funds at the filmmakers' disposal; and the technology available.

    Two particular technological limitations determined the Free Cinema aesthetic: the limited shooting time of the spring-wound Bolex 16mm camera (which meant no shot could last longer than 22 seconds), the impossibility of recording synchronised sound outside the studio until the turn of the 1960s (We Are the Lambeth Boys was one of the early experiments in that field). On the positive side, the emergence of hyper-sensitive film stock allowed filming on location without the use of artificial light, even by night.

    The filmmakers made a virtue of these financial and technological limitations: as the Free Cinema 3 programme note stated, "with a 16mm camera, and minimal resources, and no payment for your technicians, you cannot achieve very much - in commercial terms.... But you can use your eyes and your ears. You can give indications. You can make poetry." In that respect, Free Cinema advocated and developed a genuine 'aesthetic of economy'. The films may have lacked polish - some were even shot on spare (read 'scratched') government film stock - but their inner quality came from the creative way in which the filmmakers arranged sounds (often a combination of natural sounds and added music) and images, often creating symbolic contrasts between them.

     Although Anderson later denied Free Cinema the status of a genuine 'film movement', the films' concern with some aspect of contemporary life in Britain, their similar independent mode of production and their common aesthetic seem sufficient to earn it the name, however limited the movement might have been in comparison to, say, Italian neo-realism or the French New Wave.

      But Free Cinema must also to be understood as an early manifestation of a wider cultural movement, which also included a new breed of writers who began to challenge the existing social and cultural order. The 'angry young men', as they became known, focused on lower-middle-class and working-class life and were savagely critical of the institutions of English society. They included novelists Alan Sillitoe, John Braine and David Storey and playwrights Arnold Wesker and John Osborne, whose 'Look Back in Anger' (produced in 1956, shortly after the first Free Cinema programme) was the archetypal 'angry young man' work. The 'angry young men' had a direct link to Free Cinema in Tony Richardson who, with George Devine, had founded the English Stage Company at London's Royal Court Theatre, and directed both stage and film versions of Osborne's 'Look Back in Anger' (and later partnered Osborne to set up the film production company Woodfall).

      The emergence of the 'British New Wave' partly explains why Anderson and Reisz decided to end the Free Cinema series in March 1959. To some extent, this decision showed the limitations of the project as an end in itself. However, as Richardson, Reisz and Anderson were about to move on to feature filmmaking, one can, at the very least, recognise Free Cinema's significant role in the apprenticeship of filmmakers who made a major contribution to the flowering of 'social realist' cinema in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Meanwhile a handful of younger filmmakers kept the movement alive for a few more years, producing short, low-budget documentaries in the Free Cinema style.`

    content:`A big feijoada stew of politics, raw cinematic verve and sheer Brazilian-ness, spiced with a fair helping of agitprop fury, Cinema Novo probably won’t be to all modern tastes. Inspired by Italian neorealism of Rossellini and De Sica, it blasted onto Brazil’s screens in the early 1960s with impassioned social dramas and politicised directors to the fore. Key figures included Nelson Pereira dos Santos, whose semi-documentary Rio 40° was a pre-tremor for the movement in 1955, Ruy Guerra and a twentysomething firebrand by the name of Glauber Rocha. The latter’s penchant for a T-shirt friendly slogan (“The artist's goal is to outrage,” he was fond of saying) translated into Black God, White Devil in 1964, a filmic fireball that featured murder, black magic, baby sacrifice, demented camerawork and a lot of goats.

    That schizo-edited drama was just one of the jabs Cinema Novo’s directors aimed at exploitative landlords and uncaring bureaucrats. It came to epitomise what this first flaring of Latin America’s so-called Third Cinema would stand for: movies for the poor, marginalised and unrepresented of the urban favelas and the sertão scrublands against the colonisers and ruling classes. From there, the movement moved from its self-proclaimed “aesthetic of hunger” to a second and third phase that embraced the Brazil’s relationship with tropicalia, kitsch and, thankfully, to a much lesser extent, cannibalism.

    content:`Not so much a formal movement as a loose collective of filmmakers with a passion for taking the piss out of communists, the Czech New Wave put plenty of noses out of joint on the greyer side of the Iron Curtain. Its tart and often hilarious takes on the fumbling regimes of the time emerged from Prague’s famed FAMU film school, which turned out gifted directors galore. When one of them, Jiri Menzel (‘Jiri Dazeem’, if you’re John Travolta), claimed the Oscar for Best Foreign Film in 1967 with his comic masterpiece Closely Watched Trains, they were suddenly a force on the world stage too. Like many of his peers’ films, Menzel’s bildungsroman took its inspiration from Czech literature. He adapted novelist Bohumil Hrabal’s tale of a young railway worker in World War II into a wistful comic classic in the best tradition of great coming-of-age films, with unrequited love, sexy nurses and foiled Nazis galore.

    Satirical in an equally sly way, Milos Forman and Ivan Passer’s The Fireman’s Ball was a communist roast so spiky, it was banned by the ruling regime forever. As the Prague Spring fomented resistance to Soviet occupation, Forman – who would head to Hollywood in 1971 and later win Oscars for One Flew Over The Cuckoo’s Nest and Amadeus – could be found at Barrandov Studios working alongside Passer, Menzel, Ivan Kadar and Vera Chytilova (the so-called “first lady of Czech cinema”) to define the country’s cinema. Then, of course, the Soviets put a stop to all that by banning their films. It being extremely hard to argue with a man in a tank, the movement petered out in the early 1970s.

The big show-offs. In the late '60s, juiced up on the explosive momentum of the Civil Rights Movement and with LA’s Watts Riots still burning out, the uni turned out African-American filmmakers with things to say and a skilled way of saying them. Its greatest legacy, Charles Burnett’s poignant Killer Of Sheep, was the work of a few weekends and cost $10,000 (or one bajillionth of a Transformers 4), bringing a naturalistic depiction of family life and blue-collar labour in the suburbs of Watts. At the heart of it was Vietnam veteran Henry Gayle Sanders, quiet yet towering as abattoir worker Stan.

    There were plenty of other potent dramas to come – Billy Woodberry’s Bless Their Little Hearts charted a struggling couple’s efforts to keep their marriage and family together – to broaden black America’s voices in cinema away from the blaxploitation flicks of the ‘70s and towards the Spike Lee / John Singleton-fuelled renaissance of the 1980s. “The blaxploitation directors were interested in themselves and in money,” Burnett told The Telegraph, “[but] we were always arguing about how to change the way Americans saw black people.” Music played a key role in their films, with jazzy and soul soundtracking its urban. Killer Of Sheep daringly mixed Etta James, Rachmaninov and Earth, Wind And Fire, while Passing Through was a bebop tour de force thanks to John Coltrane and Charlie Parker. The former didn’t find mainstream distribution due to issues over those musical rights, but was recently given a richly-deserved 35mm restoration.

    content:`New German Cinema or ‘Neuer Deutscher Film’ (or ‘Das Sexy Fassbinder Ones With The Ladies Und Der Boobies’) emerged like a sapling from the country’s moribund postwar film industry. Culturally the country, still 20 years from farewelling Lenin, was at a low ebb. The Red Army Faction was spreading terror, the nation split down the middle and Western rock stars were soon polishing off Berlin’s heroin supplies. Into this void, like an answer to West German cineastes’ prayers, came three greats: Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Werner Herzog and Wim Wenders, as well as a phalanx of other talents that included female directors like Helma Sanders-Brahms and Margarethe von Trotta. They took 1962’s Oberhausen Manifesto, a call to arms by 26 disillusioned German filmmakers, as their springboard, parlaying its unofficial mantra “Papa’s Kino ist tot” (“Papa’s cinema is dead”) into brain-bending new visions of what cinema could be when its creators really set their minds to it.

    Their ambitions were only matched by their productivity during an incredible ten years in German cinema. When Herzog wasn’t thinking about hauling steamboats around South America, he was striking up sparky relationships with Bruno Schleinstein, a street musician better known as Bruno S., and the often barely-hinged Klaus Kinski. While Herzog was exploring man’s inner essence – the beast inside – in Aguirre, Heart Of Glass and The Enigma Of Kaspar Hauser, Fassbinder dwelt on his capacity for artifice and elaborate parlour games (The Bitter Tears Of Petra Von Kant, Fox And His Friends) and Wenders headed for the open road that would eventually lead to Paris, Texas.

    content:`If the Aussie New Wave kicked off with a kinda-horror set amid Australia’s tinnie-drinking Homo Ockerus (the startling Wake In Fright), the movement wasn’t all about utes, wifebeaters and bloke culture. Directors like Bruce Beresford, his beery creation Barry McKenzie apart, and grads from the newly established Australian Film, Television And Radio School like Phillip Noyce, Gillian Armstrong and Chris Noonan mainlined the film industry down under with energy and talent.

The more-or-less permanent sunshine enabled them to shoot in God’s own country using God’s own arc light. There was no trademark style – some, like Peter Weir, plumped for impressionistic landscapes, others opted for dust-caked realism – and the settings varied from out-there sci-fi dystopias (Mad Max) to Ben Hecht-like newsrooms (Newsfront) to the suffocating conformity of a 19th century girls’ boarding school (Picnic At Hanging Rock). The country that adopted cinema as early as 1900, three years before Edwin S. Porter’s The Great Train Robbery, was back with a bang.

If you’ve seen Mad Max: Fury Road you’ll have a flavour of what Aussie cinema looked like in the late ’70s (minus the CGI and Max Rockatansky tied to the front of a truck). It could be raw, sophisticated, character-driven and spectacular, and was often in the space of the same two hours. Between 1970 and 1985 the Australian film industry turned out 400 films, often taking inspiration from writers like Thomas Keneally (The Chant Of Jimmie Blacksmith), Joan Lindsay (Picnic At Hanging Rock) and Gabrielle Carey and Kathy Lette (Puberty Blues or ‘Pubes’ as it was known), making waves overseas and scoring openings for actors like Mel Gibson, Sam Neill, Judy Davis and Jacki Weaver in Hollywood.

    content:`Like an '80s techno riff on poetic realism, Cinéma du Look located the exact midway point between Max Ophüls and Max Headroom in an often electrifying decade of French cinema. Its trinity of directors, Jean-Jacques Beineix, Luc Besson, Leos Carax, turned out punky visions of a French underground (literally, in the case of Besson’s Subway) filled with pop promo visuals, skittish electro scores by Eric Serra and others, and a lovelorn fatalism strangely reminiscent of Marcel Carné and Jean Vigo.

The oddball romances between Christophe Lambert’s puckish Métro-dweller and Isabelle Adjani’s mysterious siren in Subway, Juliette Binoche and Denis Lavant in Carax’s Mauvais Sang, or even Anne Parillaud and her civvy boyfriend (Jean-Hugues Anglade) in Nikita betray the romantics behind the explosions, shoot-outs and amazing-bizarro visuals. Brainy types would point out that the political regime of François Mitterrand sunk the country into the kind of funk that so often breeds exciting art. We’d just point out that Nikita features several political types getting whacked.

The movement blew out like a candle flame as Besson headed to Hollywood, Beineix turned to documentaries and Carax went to ground, only resurfacing with Pola X in 1999.

    content:` Coined by Sight & Sound writer and film professor B. Ruby Rich, the term ‘New Queer Cinema’ suggests that there was an Old Queer Cinema too. And there was. The groundwork had been laid for bold new voices in gay cinema like Derek Jarman, Todd Haynes and Tom Kalin by Kenneth Anger (Scorpio Rising), Jan Oxenberg (A Comedy In Six Unnatural Acts), Gus Van Sant (Mala Noche) and Bill Sherwood. The latter’s AIDS-haunted romcom Parting Glances, which offered Steve Buscemi his first major film role, was a breakthrough for gay cinema. It was set around New York’s vibrant LGBT scene and dealt with the disease with humour and the kind of unblinking honesty that would characterise much of this unofficial movement.

    There was no Forrest Gump-style coyness in tackling the AIDS epidemic, but neither did Sherwood’s heirs fill their films with tragedy and heartache. There were more parties than funerals. Key movies include Haynes’ three-stranded Poison, Gregg Araki’s nihilistic road pic The Living End and Tom Kalin’s Swoon which followed Hitchcock’s Rope in capturing murderous yuppies Leopold and Loeb on film. These films were low-budget, often black-and-white affairs with small casts and minimal locations – Mumblecore without the mumbling – and didn’t aim to justify, varnish or in any way.

Taking its cue from Jim Jarmusch’s Stranger Than Paradise, Richard Linklater’s Before Sunrise and in particular Claudia Weill’s little seen Girlfriends — the story of a single woman struggling her way through the New York art scene is a key Mumblecore plot staple — Mumblecore is built around an aesthetic of naturalism in storytelling (they are mostly character studies of twentysomething hipsters), performance and production value. Budgets are microscopic — Joe Swanberg made a feature for $3000 — and there is a laissez-faire attitude to audible dialogue. The directors also regularly cast each other in their own work.

    The Godfather of Mumblecore is Andrew Bujalski — his first film Funny Ha Ha is cited as the movement’s opening salvo — but characteristically he denies the existence of any movement. It was Bujalski’s sound editor Eric Masunaga who coined the term in a bar at the South By Southwest film festival and Bujalski “made the mistake” of spilling it to a journo. Few movements have coined so many synonyms. Mumblecore is also known as “bedhead cinema” and “slackavetes” (a fusion of Linklater’s Slacker and US indie pioneer John Cassavetes) while the filmmakers are collectively known as “mumblecorps”.

It later gained prominence in other film industries of India.

It is known for its serious content, realism and naturalism, symbolic elements with a keen eye on the sociopolitical climate of the times, and for the rejection of inserted dance-and-song routines that are typical of mainstream Indian films.`

Forming The Drew Associates with Richard Leacock, D.A. Pennebaker, Albert Maysles, David Maysles, the group made a trio of politically charged documentaries — best of the bunch: Primary about the 1960 Presidential campaign — that sought to record the action without interference. Critical in this respect was the advent of lightweight portable cameras (chiefly the Arriflex) and the development of synchronous sound (chiefly the Nagra) that allowed a small team of filmmakers to move quickly. “My goal was to capture life in the raw,” said Drew. “My idea was to have one or two people, unobtrusive, capturing the moment.”

Direct Cinema is often described as the US equivalent of the French movement known as Cinéma Vérité. While the 1960 French film Chronicle Of A Summer is an important stepping stone towards Direct Cinema, the two terms are not inter-changeable. Both involve hand-held imagery, the sense of real life unfolding and an interest in social themes but Cinéma Vérité sees the filmmaker interact with the subject whereas the goal of Direct Cinema is to be completely unobtrusive, the presence of the camera not altering the outcome of events.`
